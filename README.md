# Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services

## Introduction
This case study focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business scenario within the banking and financial services sector.
Loan-providing companies face challenges in lending to individuals with insufficient credit histories. Companies must decide to approve or reject loans based on applicant profiles, facing two main risks:
1. Loss of Business: Not approving a loan for an applicant who is likely to repay it.
2. Financial Loss: Approving a loan for an applicant who is likely to default.

## Objective
The main objective is to uncover the driving factors behind loan defaults. This insight will help the company:
1. Deny loans to risky applicants.
2. Reduce loan amounts for high-risk applicants.
3. To ensure that creditworthy consumers are not rejected while mitigating the risk of default.
